So often we say those words, but do we mean it? Do we actually bring that request to the throne of heaven? Sadly, many times, the answer is, “no.” We have good intentions to pray, but we get busy and forget.

Lately I have seen a trend that I appreciate. When someone in my church asks for prayer for a specific need, my pastor will stop the service, call people up around the altar, and we pray. Recently, when I was visiting with another pastor in another state, we were at dinner in a restuaraunt when the pastor got a phone call with someone asking for prayer. As soon as he got off the phone, he asked us all around the table to join with him as he prayed for that individual. To me this is a good thing.

We need to take prayer requests seriously and pray as if it was our own need. So when you get the request, pray and remember to keep praying. Write it down, save it to your task manager, or ask Siri to remind you later. Prayer is important. It changes things. So let us not only say, “I will pray,” but **let us pray**.
